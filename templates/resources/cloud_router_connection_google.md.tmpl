# packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_google (Resource)

A connection from your cloud router to your Google Cloud Platform environment. For more information, see [Cloud Router in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/) and [Cloud Router NAT](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/nat/).

For examples on how to use a cloud's Terraform provider alongside PacketFabric, see [examples/use-cases](https://github.com/PacketFabric/terraform-provider-packetfabric/tree/main/examples/use-cases).

!> **Warning 1:** Adding a redundant connection to an existing Google Cloud Router Connection may cause a momentary disruption and can result in the primary BGP session going down temporarily.

!> **Warning 2:** When using `cloud_settings`, the `advertised_ip_ranges` in Google Cloud Router will be managed via BGP `in` prefixes configured `packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_google`. Also, the `advertise_mode` of the Google Cloud Router must be set to "CUSTOM".

->**Note:** It is recommended to ignore the `asn` attribute as it may be changed to a private ASN by PacketFabric in the event of multiple Google connections in the same Cloud Router.

## Example Usage

## Import

->**Note:** Import is not supported if `cloud_settings` are used.

```bash
terraform import packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_google.crc PF-L3-CUST-1700239:PF-L3-CON-2980512
