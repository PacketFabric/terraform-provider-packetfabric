# packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_google (Resource)

A connection from your cloud router to your Google Cloud Platform environment. For more information, see [Cloud Router in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/) and [Cloud Router NAT](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/nat/).

For examples on how to use a cloud's Terraform provider alongside PacketFabric, see [examples/use-cases](https://github.com/PacketFabric/terraform-provider-packetfabric/tree/main/examples/use-cases).

adding a google cloud router connection using edge availability domain 2 connected to the same google cloud router/VPC

!> **WARNING:** Use caution when adding a redundant connection (i.e. a Google Interconnect connection using edge availability domain `2`) in which both the primary and secondary connections are connected to the same Google Cloud Router and/or VPC. This may result in the primary BGP session going down temporarily.

->**NOTE 1:** The Google Cloud Terraform provider has a Cloud Router resource where you can set an `asn` attribute. This ASN may be changed to a private ASN by PacketFabric in the event of multiple Google connections within the same PacketFabric Cloud Router.

-> **NOTE 2:** The Google Cloud Terraform provider has a Cloud Router resource where you can set the `advertised_ip_ranges`.  However, you can also configure these IP ranges from the PacketFabric side using `cloud_settings.bgp_settings.prefixes` (with the `type` attribute set to `in` -- see below). Also note that the `advertise_mode` on the Google Cloud Router resource must be set to `CUSTOM`. If using an existing Google Cloud Router that is set to `DEFAULT`, we will reset it to `CUSTOM` on your behalf.

## Import

->**NOTE:** Import is not supported if `cloud_settings` are used.

Import a Cloud Router Connection using its corresponding circuit ID and the ID of the Cloud Router it is associated with, in the format `<cloud router ID>:<cloud router connection ID>`.

```bash
terraform import packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_google.crc PF-L3-CUST-1700239:PF-L3-CON-2980512
```
