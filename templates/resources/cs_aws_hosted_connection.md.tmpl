# packetfabric_cs_aws_hosted_connection (Resource)

A hosted cloud connection to your AWS environment. For more information, see [Cloud Connections in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cloud/).

For examples on how to use a cloud's Terraform provider alongside PacketFabric, see [examples/use-cases](https://github.com/PacketFabric/terraform-provider-packetfabric/tree/main/examples/use-cases).

To retrieve the VLAN ID for establishing AWS peering via [`aws_dx_transit_virtual_interface`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/dx_transit_virtual_interface) or [`aws_dx_private_virtual_interface`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/dx_private_virtual_interface), utilize the [`packetfabric_cloud_router_connections (Data Source)`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PacketFabric/packetfabric/latest/docs/data-sources/packetfabric_cloud_router_connections) and loop through its output in a `locals` block. 

The code to do this is provided below:

```terraform
locals {
  cloud_connections = data.packetfabric_cloud_router_connections.current.cloud_connections[*]
  helper_map = { for val in local.cloud_connections :
  val["description"] => val }
  cc1 = local.helper_map["${var.pf_crc_description}"]
}
output "cc1_vlan_id_pf" {
  value = one(local.cc1.cloud_settings[*].vlan_id_pf)
}
```
