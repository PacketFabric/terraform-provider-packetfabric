# packetfabric_document (Resource)

When you order a cross connect, you must provide an LOA/CFA authorizing PacketFabric access to your equipment.

If you are unfamiliar with authoring an LOA, we have provided a [template](https://docs.packetfabric.com/docs/LOA_TEMPLATE.docx).

For more information, see the [PacketFabric Cross Connect documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/xconnect/outbound/order/).

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/packetfabric_document/resource.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown }}
