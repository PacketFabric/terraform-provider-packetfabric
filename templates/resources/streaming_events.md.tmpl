# packetfabric_streaming_events (Resource)

!> **Warning:** This is a beta feature. Cloud router connections are not supported yet.

This is the first step to receive a real-time event stream via Server-sent Events.

In this resource, you declare which types of events and categories of those event types you wish to stream. 
Assuming your request is valid, the response will contain a `subscription_uuid` that you will use as a path parameter for 
the [`packetfabric_streaming_events (Data Source)`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PacketFabric/packetfabric/latest/docs/data-sources/packetfabric_streaming_events).

Each subscription bundle is permanently associated with the session that created it and can only be streamed within that session. 
Further, you must begin streaming your new subscription bundle within 5 minutes of creation or it will expire. 
However, once you begin streaming a particular bundle it will be valid until the session associated with it expires.

For more information, see [Streaming Events in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/ts/stream/).
