# packetfabric_backbone_virtual_circuit_marketplace (Resource)

Request a connection from one of your access ports to a PacketFabric marketplace provider. For more information, see [Marketplace and IX in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/eco/).

The connection will not be fully provisioned until the marketplace provider accepts the connection.

Once your request has been approved, [import the resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PacketFabric/packetfabric/latest/docs/guides/importing) as [`packetfabric_backbone_virtual_circuit`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PacketFabric/packetfabric/latest/docs/resources/packetfabric_backbone_virtual_circuit) into Terraform.

For information on automating marketplace flows, refer to the [examples/use-case](https://github.com/PacketFabric/terraform-provider-packetfabric/tree/main/examples/use-cases/marketplace).
