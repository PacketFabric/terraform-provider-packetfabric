# packetfabric_cs_google_hosted_connection (Resource)

A hosted cloud connection to your Google Cloud environment. For more information, see [Cloud Connections in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cloud/).

For examples on how to use a cloud's Terraform provider alongside PacketFabric, see [examples/use-cases](https://github.com/PacketFabric/terraform-provider-packetfabric/tree/main/examples/use-cases).

-> **NOTE:** The Google Cloud Terraform provider has a Cloud Router resource where you can set an `advertised_ip_ranges` attribute. However, you can also configure these IP ranges from the PacketFabric side using `google_advertised_ip_ranges` under `cloud_settings.bgp_settings` (see below).
