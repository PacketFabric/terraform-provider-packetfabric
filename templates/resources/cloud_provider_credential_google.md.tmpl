# packetfabric_cloud_provider_credential_google (Resource)

Adding Google Cloud Provider credentials to your PacketFabric environment allows you to perform certain tasks from within the PacketFabric portal.

If you have the `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable set up to store a Google service account JSON key, 
and you have a pretty-printed JSON file named `google_credentials.json`, you can convert it to a single line JSON string using the following command:

```bash
cat google_credentials.json | jq -c
```

!> **Warning:** Adding a redundant connection to an existing Google Cloud Router Connection may cause a momentary disruption and can result in the primary BGP session going down temporarily.
