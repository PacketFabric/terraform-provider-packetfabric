# packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_azure (Resource)

A connection from your cloud router to your Microsoft Azure environment. For more information, see [Cloud Router in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/).

For examples on how to use a cloud's Terraform provider alongside PacketFabric, see [examples/use-cases](https://github.com/PacketFabric/terraform-provider-packetfabric/tree/main/examples/use-cases).

To retrieve the VLAN ID for establishing Azure peering via [`express_route_circuit_peering`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/express_route_circuit_peering), utilize the [`packetfabric_cloud_router_connections (Data Source)`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PacketFabric/packetfabric/latest/docs/data-sources/packetfabric_cloud_router_connections) and loop through its output in a `locals` block. 

The code to do this is provided below:

```terraform
locals {
  cloud_connections = data.packetfabric_cloud_router_connections.current.cloud_connections[*]
  helper_map = { for val in local.cloud_connections :
  val["description"] => val }
  cc1 = local.helper_map["${var.pf_crc_description}-primary"]
}
output "cc1_vlan_private" {
  value = one(local.cc1.cloud_settings[*].vlan_id_private)
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "packetfabric_cloud_router" "cr1" {
  provider = packetfabric
  asn      = 4556
  name     = "hello world"
  capacity = "10Gbps"
  regions  = ["US", "UK"]
  labels   = ["terraform", "dev"]
}

resource "packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_azure" "crc4" {
  provider          = packetfabric
  description       = "hello world"
  circuit_id        = packetfabric_cloud_router.cr1.id
  azure_service_key = var.pf_crc_azure_service_key
  speed             = "1Gbps"
  maybe_nat         = false
  is_public         = false
  labels            = ["terraform", "dev"]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `account_uuid` (String) The UUID for the billing account that should be billed. Can also be set with the PF_ACCOUNT_ID environment variable.
- `azure_service_key` (String) The Service Key provided by Microsoft Azure when you created your ExpressRoute circuit.
- `circuit_id` (String) Circuit ID of the target cloud router. This starts with "PF-L3-CUST-".
- `description` (String) A brief description of this connection.
- `speed` (String) The speed of the new connection.

	Enum: ["50Mbps" "100Mbps" "200Mbps" "300Mbps" "400Mbps" "500Mbps" "1Gbps" "2Gbps" "5Gbps" "10Gbps"]

### Optional

- `is_public` (Boolean) Whether PacketFabric should allocate a public IP address for this connection. Set this to true if you intend to set up peering with Microsoft public services (such as Microsoft 365). Defaults: false
- `labels` (List of String) Label value linked to an object.
- `maybe_dnat` (Boolean) Set this to true if you intend to use DNAT on this connection. Defaults: false
- `maybe_nat` (Boolean) Set this to true if you intend to use NAT on this connection. Defaults: false
- `po_number` (String) Purchase order number or identifier of a service.
- `published_quote_line_uuid` (String) UUID of the published quote line with which this connection should be associated.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `azure_connection_type` (String) The Azure connection type.
		Example: primary or seconday
- `etl` (Number) Early Termination Liability (ETL) fees apply when terminating a service before its term ends. ETL is prorated to the remaining contract days.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `vlan_id_microsoft` (Number) The microsoft peering vlan.
- `vlan_id_private` (Number) The private peering vlan.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `read` (String)
- `update` (String)




## Import

Import a Cloud Router Connection using its corresponding circuit ID and the ID of the Cloud Router it is associated with, in the format `<cloud router ID>:<cloud router connection ID>`.

```bash
terraform import packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_azure.crc PF-L3-CUST-1700239:PF-L3-CON-2980512
```
