# packetfabric_cloud_router_bgp_session (Resource)

The BGP session information for a cloud router connection. 

For information specific to each cloud provider, see [the PacketFabric cloud router BGP documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/bgp/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    packetfabric = {
      source  = "packetfabric/packetfabric"
      version = "~> 0.0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "packetfabric" {
  host = var.pf_api_server
  token = var.pf_api_key
}

data "packetfabric_cloud_router" "current" {
  provider = packetfabric
}

data "packetfabric_cloud_router_bgp_session" "current" {
  provider = packetfabric
}

## Schema

### Required

- `address_family` (String) Whether this instance is IPv4 or IPv6. At this time, only IPv4 is supported. 
		Enum: "v4" "v6"
- `circuit_id` (String) Circuit ID of the target cloud router. This starts with "PF-L3-CUST-".
- `connection_id` (String) The circuit ID of the connection associated with the BGP session. This starts with "PF-L3-CON-".
- `l3_address` (String) The L3 Address of this instance. Not used for Azure connections.
- `md5` (String) The MD5 value of the authenticated BGP sessions.
- `multihop_ttl` (Number) The TTL of this session. The default is `1`. For Google Cloud connections, see [the PacketFabric doc](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/bgp/bgp_google/#ttl).
- `orlonger` (Boolean) Whether to use exact match or longer for all prefixes.
- `remote_address` (String) The cloud-side router peer IP.
- `remote_asn` (Number) The cloud-side ASN.

### Optional

- `as_prepend` (Number) The BGP prepend value for this instance.
- `bfd_interval` (Number) If you are using BFD, this is the interval (in milliseconds) at which to send test packets to peers.
		Available range is 3 through 30000.
- `bfd_multiplier` (Number) If you are using BFD, this is the number of consecutive packets that can be lost before BFD considers a peer down and shuts down BGP. 
		Available range is 2 through 16.
- `community` (Number) The BGP community for this instance.
- `disabled` (Boolean) Whether this BGP session is disabled.
		Default "false"
- `local_preference` (Number) The preference for this instance. When the same route is received in multiple locations, those with a higher local preference value are preferred by the cloud router.
- `med` (Number) The Multi-Exit Discriminator of this instance. When the same route is advertised in multiple locations, those with a lower MED are preferred by the peer AS.
- `pool_prefixes` (List of String) If using NAT, all prefixes that are NATed on this connection will be translated to the pool prefix address.
- `pre_nat_sources` (List of String) If using NAT, this is the prefixes from the cloud that you want to associate with the NAT pool.
- `primary_subnet` (String) Currently for Azure use only, provide this as the primary subnet when creating an Azure cloud router connection.
- `secondary_subnet` (String) Currently for Azure use only, provide this as the secondary subnet when creating an Azure cloud router connection.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
