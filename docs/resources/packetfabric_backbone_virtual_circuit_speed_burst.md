# packetfabric_backbone_virtual_circuit_speed_burst (Resource)

Burst the capacity on an existing virtual circuit. For more information, see [Capacity Bursts in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/vc/manage/burst/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "packetfabric_backbone_virtual_circuit_speed_burst" "boost" {
  provider      = packetfabric
  vc_circuit_id = var.pf_vc_circuit_id
  speed         = var.pf_vc_speed_burst
}

output "packetfabric_backbone_virtual_circuit_speed_burst" {
  value = packetfabric_backbone_virtual_circuit_speed_burst.boost
}
```

- `vc_circuit_id` (String) The circuit ID of the virtual circuit that you are bursting.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
