}
provider "packetfabric" {
  host  = var.pf_api_server

## Schema

### Required

- `account_uuid` (String) The UUID for the billing account that should be billed. This is your billing account, not the marketplace provider's.
- `market` (String) The market code (e.g. "ATL" or "DAL") in which you would like the marketplace provider to provision their side of the connection.

	If the marketplace provider has services published in the marketplace, you can use the PacketFabric portal to see which POPs they are in. Simply remove the number from the POP to get the market code (e.g. if they offer services in "DAL5", enter "DAL" for the market).
- `routing_id` (String) The routing ID of the marketplace provider that will be receiving this request.

	Example: TR-1RI-OQ85
- `speed` (String) The speed of the new connection.

	Enum: ["50Mbps", "100Mbps", "200Mbps", "300Mbps", "400Mbps", "500Mbps", "1Gbps", "2Gbps", "5Gbps", "10Gbps"]

### Optional

- `azure_service_key` (String) The Service Key provided by Microsoft Azure when you created your ExpressRoute circuit.
- `description` (String) A brief description of this connection.
- `service_uuid` (String) UUID of the marketplace service being requested.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `zone` (String) The desired zone of the new connection. Optional
