# packetfabric_link_aggregation_group (Resource)

A Link Aggregation Group interface (or a LAG) is a group of ports on the PacketFabric network. For more information, see [Ports in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/ports/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a PacketFabric interfaces
resource "packetfabric_port" "port_1a" {
  provider          = packetfabric
  autoneg           = true
  description       = "hello world-a"
  media             = "LX"
  nni               = false
  pop               = "SEA2"
  speed             = "1Gbps"
  subscription_term = 1
  zone              = "A"
  labels            = ["terraform", "dev"]
}

## 2nd port in the same location same zone to create a LAG
resource "packetfabric_port" "port_1b" {
  provider          = packetfabric
  autoneg           = true
  description       = "hello world-b"
  media             = "LX"
  nni               = false
  pop               = "SEA2"
  speed             = "1Gbps"
  subscription_term = 1
  zone              = "B"
  labels            = ["terraform", "dev"]
}

resource "packetfabric_link_aggregation_group" "lag_1" {
  provider    = packetfabric
  description = "hello world"
  interval    = "fast" # or slow
  members     = [packetfabric_port.port_1a.id, packetfabric_port.port_1b.id]
  pop         = "SEA2"
  labels      = ["terraform", "dev"]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) A brief description of the LAG.
- `interval` (String) The LACP interval determines the frequency in which LACP control packets (LACP PDUs) are sent. If you specify fast, they are sent at 1 second intervals. If you specify slow, they are sent at 30 second intervals.

	Enum: "fast" "slow"
- `members` (List of String) A list of port circuit IDs to include in the LAG. To be included in a LAG, the ports must be at the same site, in the same zone, and have the same speed and media.
- `pop` (String) Point of presence in which the LAG should be located.

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) Change LAG Admin Status. Set it to true when LAG is enabled, false when LAG is disabled. Defaults: true
- `labels` (Set of String) Label value linked to an object.
- `po_number` (String) Purchase order number or identifier of a service.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `read` (String)
- `update` (String)




## Import

Import a LAG using its circuit ID. 

```bash
terraform import packetfabric_link_aggregation_group.lag_1 PF-AE-WDC1-1726464
```
