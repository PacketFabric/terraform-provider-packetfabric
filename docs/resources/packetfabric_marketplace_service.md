# packetfabric_marketplace_service (Resource)

Create a service to make available through the PacketFabric marketplace. For more information, see [Marketplace & IX in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/eco/). 



## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a Marketplace Service type quick-connect
resource "packetfabric_marketplace_service" "marketplace_quick_connect" {
  provider     = packetfabric
  name         = "hello world"
  description  = "hello world quick connect"
  service_type = "quick-connect-service"
  sku          = "001234567"
  categories = [
    "cloud-computing",
    "security",
    "web-hosting"
  ]
  published               = true
  cloud_router_circuit_id = "PF-L3-CUST-2839140"
  connection_circuit_ids = [
    "PF-L3-CON-2853999",
    "PF-L3-CON-2888830"
  ]
  route_set {
    description = "hello world route set"
    is_private  = false
    prefixes {
      prefix     = "185.56.153.165/32"
      match_type = "orlonger"
    }
    prefixes {
      prefix     = "185.56.153.166/32"
      match_type = "orlonger"
    }
  }
}
output "packetfabric_marketplace_service_quick_connect" {
  value = packetfabric_marketplace_service.marketplace_quick_connect
}

# Create a Marketplace Service type port
resource "packetfabric_marketplace_service" "marketplace_port" {
  provider     = packetfabric
  name         = "hello world port"
  description  = "hello world"
  service_type = "port-service"
  sku          = "001234567"
  categories = [
    "cloud-computing",
    "security",
    "web-hosting"
  ]
  published = true
  locations = [
    "PDX1",
    "SFO2"
  ]
}
output "packetfabric_marketplace_service_port" {
  value = packetfabric_marketplace_service.marketplace_port
}

- `cloud_router_circuit_id` (String) The circuit ID of the Cloud Router this service is associated with (Quick Connect service only).
- `connection_circuit_ids` (List of String) The circuit IDs of the Cloud Router connections that will be included in this service. (Quick Connect service only).
- `description` (String) Brief description of what the service does.
- `locations` (List of String) Locations in which the service will operate (port service only). The location should be a POP, e.g. `NYC5`.
- `route_set` (Block Set) The Cloud Router route set to export (Quick Connect service only). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--route_set))
- `service_type` (String) The service type of this service. Enum: `"port-service"`, `"quick-connect-service"`

	Defaults: port-service
- `sku` (String) A SKU identifier for the service. This is not shown to the A side user (the requestor).
