# packetfabric_cs_aws_hosted_connection (Resource)

A hosted cloud connection to your AWS environment. For more information, see [Cloud Connections in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cloud/).

For examples on how to use a cloud's Terraform provider alongside PacketFabric, see [examples/use-cases](https://github.com/PacketFabric/terraform-provider-packetfabric/tree/main/examples/use-cases).

To retrieve the VLAN ID for establishing AWS peering via [`aws_dx_transit_virtual_interface`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/dx_transit_virtual_interface) or [`aws_dx_private_virtual_interface`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/dx_private_virtual_interface), utilize the [`packetfabric_cloud_router_connections (Data Source)`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PacketFabric/packetfabric/latest/docs/data-sources/packetfabric_cloud_router_connections) and loop through its output in a `locals` block. 

The code to do this is provided below:

```terraform
locals {
  cloud_connections = data.packetfabric_cloud_router_connections.current.cloud_connections[*]
  helper_map = { for val in local.cloud_connections :
  val["description"] => val }
  cc1 = local.helper_map["${var.pf_crc_description}"]
}
output "cc1_vlan_id_pf" {
  value = one(local.cc1.cloud_settings[*].vlan_id_pf)
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "packetfabric_cs_aws_hosted_connection" "cs_conn1_hosted_aws" {
  provider    = packetfabric
  description = var.pf_description
  port        = var.pf_port
  speed       = var.pf_cs_speed
  pop         = var.pf_cs_pop
  vlan        = var.pf_cs_vlan
  zone        = var.pf_cs_zone
}

output "packetfabric_cs_aws_hosted_connection" {
  value = packetfabric_cs_aws_hosted_connection.cs_conn1_hosted_aws
}
```

```

## Provisioning lead time

Please check availability at your chosen location before provisioning. 
If there are no hosted cloud connections available at the chosen location, provisioning can take up to two weeks.
