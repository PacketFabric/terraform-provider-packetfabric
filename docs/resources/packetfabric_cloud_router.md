The PacketFabric Cloud Router enables multi-cloud connectivity between cloud service providers. For example, it can help you exchange data between your AWS environment and your Google Cloud environment.

For more information, see the [PacketFabric Cloud Router documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/overview/).


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "packetfabric_cloud_router" "cr1" {
  provider     = packetfabric
  scope        = var.pf_cr_scope
  asn          = var.pf_cr_asn
  name         = var.pf_cr_name
  account_uuid = var.pf_account_uuid
  capacity     = var.pf_cr_capacity
  regions      = var.pf_cr_regions
}

output "packetfabric_cloud_router" {
  value = packetfabric_cloud_router.cr1
}
