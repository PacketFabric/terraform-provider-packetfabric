# packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_aws (Resource)

A connection from your cloud router to your AWS environment. For more information, see [Cloud Router in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/).

For examples on how to use a cloud's Terraform provider alongside PacketFabric, see [examples/use-cases](https://github.com/PacketFabric/terraform-provider-packetfabric/tree/main/examples/use-cases).

To retrieve the VLAN ID for establishing AWS peering via [`aws_dx_transit_virtual_interface`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/dx_transit_virtual_interface) or [`aws_dx_private_virtual_interface`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/dx_private_virtual_interface), utilize the [`packetfabric_cloud_router_connections (Data Source)`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PacketFabric/packetfabric/latest/docs/data-sources/packetfabric_cloud_router_connections) and loop through its output in a `locals` block. 

The code to do this is provided below:

```terraform
locals {
  cloud_connections = data.packetfabric_cloud_router_connections.current.cloud_connections[*]
  helper_map = { for val in local.cloud_connections :
  val["description"] => val }
  cc1 = local.helper_map["${var.pf_crc_description}"]
}
output "cc1_vlan_id_pf" {
  value = one(local.cc1.cloud_settings[*].vlan_id_pf)
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "packetfabric_cloud_router" "cr1" {
  provider = packetfabric
  asn      = var.pf_cr_asn
  name     = var.pf_cr_name
  capacity = var.pf_cr_capacity
  regions  = var.pf_cr_regions
}

resource "packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_aws" "crc1" {
  provider    = packetfabric
  circuit_id  = packetfabric_cloud_router.cr1.id
  maybe_nat   = var.pf_crc_maybe_nat
  description = var.pf_crc_description
  pop         = var.pf_crc_pop
  zone        = var.pf_crc_zone
  is_public   = var.pf_crc_is_public
  speed       = var.pf_crc_speed
}

output "packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_aws" {
  value = packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_aws.crc1
}

# Wait for the connection to show up in AWS
resource "time_sleep" "wait_aws_connection" {
  create_duration = "2m"
  depends_on = [
    packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_aws.crc1
  ]
}

# Retrieve the Direct Connect connections in AWS
data "aws_dx_connection" "current" {
  provider   = aws
  name       = var.pf_crc_description
  depends_on = [time_sleep.wait_aws_connection]
}

# Accept the connection
resource "aws_dx_connection_confirmation" "confirmation" {
  provider      = aws
  connection_id = data.aws_dx_connection.current.id
}
```

## Import

Import a Cloud Router Connection using its corresponding circuit ID and the ID of the Cloud Router it is associated with, in the format `<cloud router ID>:<cloud router connection ID>`.

```bash
terraform import packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_aws.crc PF-L3-CUST-1700239:PF-L3-CON-2980512
```
