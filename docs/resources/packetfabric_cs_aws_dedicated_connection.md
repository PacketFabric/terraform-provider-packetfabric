# packetfabric_cs_aws_dedicated_connection (Resource)

A port located in an AWS cloud on-ramp facility, which will be connected to the AWS network via cross connect. For more information, see [Cloud Connections in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cloud/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "packetfabric_cs_aws_dedicated_connection" "pf_cs_conn1_dedicated_aws" {
  provider          = packetfabric
  aws_region        = var.aws_region
  description       = var.pf_description
  zone              = var.pf_cs_zone
  pop               = var.pf_cs_pop
  subscription_term = var.pf_cs_subterm
  service_class     = var.pf_cs_srvclass
  autoneg           = var.pf_cs_autoneg
  speed             = var.pf_cs_speed
  should_create_lag = var.should_create_lag
}

output "packetfabric_cs_aws_dedicated_connection" {
  value = packetfabric_cs_aws_dedicated_connection.pf_cs_conn1_dedicated_aws
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `account_uuid` (String) The UUID for the billing account that should be billed. Can also be set with the PF_ACCOUNT_ID environment variable.
- `autoneg` (Boolean) Whether the port auto-negotiates or not. This is currently only possible with 1Gbps ports and the request will fail if specified with 10Gbps.
- `aws_region` (String) The region that the new connection will connect to.

	Example: us-west-1
- `description` (String) A brief description of this connection.
- `pop` (String) The POP in which the dedicated port should be provisioned (the cloud on-ramp).

	Example: DAL1
- `service_class` (String) The service class for the given port, either long haul or metro. Specify metro if the cloud on-ramp (the `pop`) is in the same market as the source ports (the ports to which you will be building out virtual circuits).

	Enum: ["longhaul","metro"]
- `speed` (String) The desired capacity of the port.

	Enum: ["1Gps", "10Gbps"]
- `subscription_term` (Number) The billing term, in months, for this connection.

	Enum: ["1", "12", "24", "36"]

### Optional

- `loa` (String) A base64 encoded string of a PDF of the LOA that AWS provided.

	Example: SSBhbSBhIFBERg==
- `should_create_lag` (Boolean) Create the dedicated connection as a LAG interface.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `zone` (String) The desired AWS availability zone of the new connection.

	Example: "A"

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `read` (String)
- `update` (String)
