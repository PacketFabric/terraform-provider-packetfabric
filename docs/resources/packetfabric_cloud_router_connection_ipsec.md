# packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_ipsec (Resource)

An IPsec VPN connection from your cloud router. For more information, see the following PacketFabric documentation:

* [Cloud Router](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/)
* [Site-to-Site VPN for Cloud Router](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/vpn/)
* [VPN Configuration](https://docs.packetfabric.com/cr/ref/vpn_devices/)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "packetfabric_cloud_router" "cr1" {
  provider     = packetfabric
  asn          = var.pf_cr_asn
  name         = var.pf_cr_name
  capacity     = var.pf_cr_capacity
  regions      = var.pf_cr_regions
}

resource "packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_ipsec" "crc3" {
  provider                     = packetfabric
  description                  = var.pf_crc_description
  circuit_id                   = packetfabric_cloud_router.cr1.id
  pop                          = var.pf_crc_pop
  speed                        = var.pf_crc_speed
  gateway_address              = var.pf_crc_gateway_address
  ike_version                  = var.pf_crc_ike_version
  phase1_authentication_method = var.pf_crc_phase1_authentication_method
  phase1_group                 = var.pf_crc_phase1_group
  phase1_encryption_algo       = var.pf_crc_phase1_encryption_algo
  phase1_authentication_algo   = var.pf_crc_phase1_authentication_algo
  phase1_lifetime              = var.pf_crc_phase1_lifetime
  phase2_pfs_group             = var.pf_crc_phase2_pfs_group
  phase2_encryption_algo       = var.pf_crc_phase2_encryption_algo
  phase2_authentication_algo   = var.pf_crc_phase2_authentication_algo
  phase2_lifetime              = var.pf_crc_phase2_lifetime
  shared_key                   = var.pf_crc_shared_key
}

output "packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_ipsec" {
  value = packetfabric_cloud_router_connection_ipsec.crc3
}

## Schema

### Required

- `account_uuid` (String) The UUID for the billing account that should be billed. Can also be set with the PF_ACCOUNT_ID environment variable.
- `circuit_id` (String) Circuit ID of the target cloud router. This starts with "PF-L3-CUST-".
- `description` (String) A brief description of this connection.
- `gateway_address` (String) The gateway address of your VPN device. Because VPNs traverse the public internet, this must be a public IP address owned by you.
- `ike_version` (Number) The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version supported by your device. In most cases, this is v2 (v1 is deprecated).

	Enum: 1, 2.
- `phase1_authentication_algo` (String) The authentication algorithm to use during phase 1.

	Enum: "md5" "sha-256" "sha-384" "sha1"
- `phase1_authentication_method` (String) The authentication method to use during phase 1. For example, "pre-shared-key".
- `phase1_encryption_algo` (String) The encryption algorithm to use during phase 1.

	Enum: "3des-cbc" "aes-128-cbc" "aes-192-cbc" "aes-256-cbc" "des-cbc"
- `phase1_group` (String) Phase 1 is when the VPN peers are authenticated and we establish security associations (SAs) to protect IKE messaging between the two endpoints (which in this case is PacketFabric and your VPN device). This is also known as the IKE phase.

	The Phase 1 group is the Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm used to create a shared secret between the endpoints.

	Enum: "group1" "group14" "group15" "group16" "group19" "group2" "group20" "group24" "group5"
- `phase1_lifetime` (Number) The time in seconds before a tunnel will need to re-authenticate. The phase 1 lifetime should be equal to or longer than phase 2. This can be between 180 and 86400.
- `phase2_encryption_algo` (String) The encryption algorithm to use during phase 2.

	Enum: "3des-cbc" "aes-128-cbc" "aes-128-gcm" "aes-192-cbc" "aes-192-gcm" "aes-256-cbc" "aes-256-gcm" "des-cbc"
- `phase2_lifetime` (Number) The time in seconds before phase 2 expires and needs to reauthenticate. We recommend that the phase 2 lifetime is equal to or shorter than phase 1. This can be between 180 and 86400.
- `phase2_pfs_group` (String) Phase 2 is when SAs are further established to protect and encrypt IP traffic within the tunnel. This is also known as the IPsec phase.

	The PFS group is the Perfect Forward Secrecy group. This means that rather than using the keys from phase 1, new keys are generated per the selected Diffie-Hellman algorithm (same as those listed above).

	Enum: "group1" "group14" "group15" "group16" "group19" "group2" "group20" "group24" "group5"
- `pop` (String) The POP in which you want to provision the connection.
- `shared_key` (String) The pre-shared-key to use for authentication.
- `speed` (String) The desired speed of the new connection.

	Enum: ["50Mbps" "100Mbps" "200Mbps" "300Mbps" "400Mbps" "500Mbps" "1Gbps" "2Gbps"]

### Optional

- `phase2_authentication_algo` (String) The authentication algorithm to use during phase 2. It cannot be null if phase2_encryption_algo is CBC. 

	Enum: "hmac-md5-96" "hmac-sha-256-128" "hmac-sha1-96"
- `published_quote_line_uuid` (String) UUID of the published quote line with which this connection should be associated.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `read` (String)
- `update` (String)
