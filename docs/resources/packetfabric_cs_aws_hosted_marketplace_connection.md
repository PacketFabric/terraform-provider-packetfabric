## Schema

### Required

- `account_uuid` (String) The UUID for the billing account that should be billed. This is your billing account, not the marketplace provider's.
- `aws_account_id` (String) The AWS account ID to connect with. Must be 12 characters long.
- `market` (String) The market code (e.g. "ATL" or "DAL") in which you would like the marketplace provider to provision their side of the connection.

	If the marketplace provider has services published in the marketplace, you can use the PacketFabric portal to see which POPs they are in. Simply remove the number from the POP to get the market code (e.g. if they offer services in "DAL5", enter "DAL" for the market).
- `routing_id` (String) The routing ID of the marketplace provider that will be receiving this request.

	Example: TR-1RI-OQ85
- `speed` (String) The speed of the new connection.

	Enum: ["50Mbps", "100Mbps", "200Mbps", "300Mbps", "400Mbps", "500Mbps", "1Gbps", "2Gbps", "5Gbps", "10Gbps"]

### Optional

- `description` (String) A brief description of this connection.
- `pop` (String) The POP in which the hosted connection should be provisioned (the cloud on-ramp).
