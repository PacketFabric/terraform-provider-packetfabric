# PacketFabric Provider

You can use the PacketFabric Terraform provider to create and manage PacketFabric services. 

For information on how to get started, see [Getting Started](guides/getting_started) or [Terraform with PacketFabric in the PacketFabric knowledge base](https://docs.packetfabric.com/api/terraform/).

## Before you begin

You will need a PacketFabric user account with appropriate permissions. See [User Permissions](https://docs.packetfabric.com/admin/user/permissions/) in the PacketFabric documentation.

You will also need an API key. See [Getting Started](guides/getting_started). 

## Using with other Terraform providers

If you are using Terraform to create cloud connections, there are typically actions that you need to take from the cloud side (for example, accepting connections or retrieving service keys). 

To do this, you will need appropriate access to that cloud environment. 

You can handle these manually through the cloud service provider's console, or you can use their Terraform provider:

* https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest
* https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest
* https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest
* https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest
* https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest


For examples on how to use a cloud's Terraform provider alongside PacketFabric, see [examples/use-cases](examples/use-cases).

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    packetfabric = {
      source  = "PacketFabric/packetfabric"
      version = ">= 0.4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "packetfabric" {
  host  = var.pf_api_server
  token = var.pf_api_key
}
```
