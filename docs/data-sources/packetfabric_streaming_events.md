# packetfabric_streaming_events (Data Source)

!> **Warning:** This is a beta feature. Cloud router connections are not supported yet.

Ensure that you have created a subscription bundle using the [`packetfabric_streaming_events (Resource)`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PacketFabric/packetfabric/latest/docs/resources/packetfabric_streaming_events) resource and that you have access to the `subscription_uuid` returned from that resource.

Each subscription bundle is permanently associated with the session that created it and can only be streamed within that session. 
Further, you must begin streaming your new subscription bundle within 5 minutes of creation or it will expire. 
However, once you begin streaming a particular bundle it will be valid until the session associated with it expires.

For more information, see [Streaming Events in the PacketFabric documentation](https://docs.packetfabric.com/ts/stream/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "packetfabric_streaming_events" "example" {
  provider = packetfabric
  streams {
    type   = "customer"
    events = ["auth", "physical_interface"]
  }

  streams {
    type   = "port"
    ifds   = ["PF-AP-ABC-1234", "PF-AE-DEF-5678"]
    events = ["errors", "etherstats", "metrics", "optical"]
  }

  streams {
    type   = "vc"
    vcs    = ["PF-BC-ABC-QRS-84274-PF&PF-AP-ABC-1234", "PF-CC-JKL-DEF-13758-PF&PF-AE-DEF-5678"]
    events = ["metrics"]
  }
}

data "packetfabric_streaming_events" "example" {
  provider        = packetfabric
  subscription_id = packetfabric_streaming_events.example.id
  stream_time     = 1 # min
}
output "packetfabric_streaming_events_result" {
  value = data.packetfabric_streaming_events.example.events
}
resource "local_file" "packetfabric_streaming_events_output" {
  content  = jsonencode(data.packetfabric_streaming_events.example.events)
  filename = "packetfabric_streaming_events_output.json"
}
```
